# Workflow Automation Variable Field Enhancements

## Implementation Summary

Enhanced the variable name fields across four key workflow automation node types to improve data flow visualization and reference capabilities:

### 1. ConditionNode
- Added a well-styled variable name input field with purple-themed UI
- Displays the variable reference syntax `{{variableName}}` with visual indicators
- Default variable name based on node type and ID: `condition_[id]`
- Added reference information in help panel
- Added status indicator showing current variable name

### 2. TimeNode
- Enhanced variable name input with indigo/purple styling
- Improved variable reference display with clear syntax examples
- Default naming pattern follows `time_[id]`
- UI color matches the node's existing color scheme
- Added variable name reference in node documentation

### 3. MergeNode
- Added styled variable name field with rounded border and background
- Shows reference information with proper syntax highlighting
- Default naming pattern follows `merge_[id]`
- Added variable name preview in status bar
- Maintains visual consistency with the node's purple color scheme

### 4. Text to SQL Node (TTSQLNode)
- Implemented enhanced variable name field with indigo styling
- Shows reference syntax with clear visual indicators
- Default naming pattern follows `sql_[id]`
- Variable name displayed in status bar
- Maintains consistent styling with node design

## General Improvements
- All variable input fields now have:
  - Clear visual indication of the `{{...}}` syntax with styled prefix/suffix
  - Info text explaining how to reference the variable in other nodes
  - Default variable names that are more intuitive based on node type
  - Consistent styling matching each node's color scheme
  - Better visual hierarchy with improved spacing and borders

These enhancements make the workflow system more intuitive by providing explicit variable naming rather than relying on implicit connections. Users can now easily reference node outputs in subsequent nodes using the consistent variable syntax.
