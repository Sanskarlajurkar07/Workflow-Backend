- ✅ Proper type handling for different input formats

### 3. **Improved Result Processing**
- ✅ Consistent result formatting across all node types
- ✅ Proper handling of NodeResult objects vs raw values
- ✅ Better error handling and partial result recovery

### 4. **Enhanced Variable Processing**

├─ output-1: AI processed: Summarize this: This is a test text for workflow execution...

🔍 VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION TEST:
✅ Variable substitution working correctly

🎉 CORE EXECUTION ENGINE IS WORKING!
✅ All nodes executed correctly
✅ Data flows between nodes
✅ Variable substitution works
✅ Execution order is correct
```

## 🚀 What Now Works

### ✅ **Complete Workflow Execution**
- Input nodes receive and process initial data
- Processing nodes (AI, transformation) work on data
- Output nodes format and return results
- All nodes execute in correct dependency order

### ✅ **Proper Data Flow**
- Variables like `{{node_name.output}}` are correctly substituted
- Node outputs are accessible to downstream nodes
- Data types are preserved throughout the workflow

### ✅ **Result Reporting**
- Full execution statistics and timing
- Individual node results and status
- Partial results preserved on errors
- Detailed execution paths

### ✅ **Error Resilience**
- Individual node failures don't crash workflows
- Partial execution results are returned
- Clear error messages and status codes

## 🔄 API Response Format

Your workflows now return properly structured responses:

```json
{
  "execution_id": "...",
  "workflow_id": "...", 
  "status": "completed",
  "results": {
    "input-1": {
      "output": "user input text",
      "text": "user input text",
      "node_name": "test_input"
    },
    "ai-1": {
      "output": "AI processed result",
      "response": "AI processed result", 
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    },
    "output-1": {
      "output": "Final formatted result",
      "template": "Final result: {{ai_processor.output}}"
    }
  },
  "node_results": {
    "input-1": {
      "status": "completed",
      "execution_time": 0.001,
      "output": {...},
      "node_type": "input"

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. **Create a Workflow**
```javascript
const workflow = {
  name: "Test Workflow",
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "input-1",
      type: "input", 
      data: { params: { nodeName: "user_input", type: "Text" } }
    },
    {
      id: "ai-1",
      type: "openai",
      data: { 
        params: { 
          nodeName: "ai_processor",
          model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
          prompt: "Process this: {{user_input.output}}"
        } 
      }
    },
    {
      id: "output-1", 
      type: "output",
      data: { 
        params: { 
          nodeName: "final_result",
          output: "Result: {{ai_processor.output}}"
        } 
      }
    }
  ],
  edges: [
    { source: "input-1", target: "ai-1" },
    { source: "ai-1", target: "output-1" }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Execute the Workflow**
```javascript
const execution = {
  inputs: {
    "input": "Your text to process"
  }
}

// POST /workflows/{workflow_id}/execute
```

### 3. **Get Results**
- ✅ Individual node outputs in `results`
- ✅ Execution details in `node_results` 
- ✅ Overall stats in `execution_stats`
- ✅ Timing information in `execution_time`
